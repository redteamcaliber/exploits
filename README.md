# HOW TO CONTRIBUTE?

Pick an Exploit that is not yet in this Repository, and port it to
[Ronin Exploits](http://github.com/ronin-ruby/ronin-exploits#readme).
[www.exploit-db.com](http://www.exploit-db.com/) is a good place to look
for recent Exploits.

**Note:** Please do not port XSS or SQL Injection Exploits, as they are
usually trivial to scan for. Besides XSS is totally LAAAAAME ...

**Note:** Do not submit 0days. Don't be stupid, keep those top secret. ;)
